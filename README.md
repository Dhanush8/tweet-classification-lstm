# Tweet Classification using LSTM & Bi-LSTM  
**CSC4093: Neural Networks and Deep Learning â€“ Programming Assignment 02**

This project implements LSTM and Bi-LSTM models to classify tweets as **personal health mentions** or **non-personal health mentions**.

## Summary

- **Task**: Binary classification of tweets.  
- **Models**: LSTM and Bi-LSTM with text embeddings.  
- **Goal**: Compare model performance and analyze results.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`  
- **Text Preprocessing**: `nltk`, `re`  
- **Modeling**: `TensorFlow/Keras` (`Embedding`, `LSTM`, `Bi-LSTM`, `Dense`)  
- **Training & Evaluation**: `train_test_split`, `ModelCheckpoint`, `matplotlib`

## Output

- Model training scripts and performance plots  
- Accuracy/loss comparison  
- Final discussion and model insights
